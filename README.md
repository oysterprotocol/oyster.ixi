# Oyster.ixi

Provides an API method `Oyster.findSignatures` that returns the signatures of the first* transaction associated with each given address.

This saves a roundtrip, the overhead of transmitting the whole transaction, as well as skipping any additional transactions `findTransactions` would return.

Additionally provides a more recent method `Oyster.findGeneratedSignatures`. This approach moves part of the datamap generation from the client to the server, easing the load on the clients upstream during download. Suggestions for a better method name welcome.

* - this needs some work
